## Description
Work Day Scheduler is an application that allows you to easily keep track of all your tasks, meetings, and to-dos during the work day.  The application displays the current date at the top of the page and each hour is color-coded to allow the user to know whether an event is in the past, present, or future. Work Day Scheduler is easy to use - just enter your events in each block and click the save button.  Your events will save even when the page is refreshed!
